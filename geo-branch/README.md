Group members: Chantilly Apollon, Ada Jacques, Leonardo Garcia, Geo Wong

Objective: This project is to create a collaboration between the team members to provide available data provided by NASA's Curiosity, InSight, and Perserverance rovers that have visited Mars. The project is created with open sourced API from NASA which allowed the team to collect and present the data to the general public. 

Goal: We wish to help the general public learn and enjoy the weather conditions on Mars. We welcome open contribution from other individuals who wish to help create an even better experience.
